# Dark Pool Collector Pagination Improvements

## Problem
The dark pool collector was taking over an hour to run because it was:
1. Making thousands of API calls (over 3,800 pages)
2. Not properly using the `newer_than` parameter
3. Not limiting the number of pages fetched
4. Not effectively tracking progress

## Solution
We made several improvements to the collector:

### 1. URL Construction Fix
- Fixed duplicate `/api` in the URL path
- Changed from: `f"{UW_BASE_URL}/api/darkpool/{symbol}"`
- To: `f"{UW_BASE_URL}/darkpool/{symbol}"`

### 2. Time Module Fix
- Fixed `time.sleep()` issue by properly importing the standard library `time` module
- Aliased `datetime.time` as `dt_time` to avoid naming conflicts

### 3. Pagination Optimization
- Added a `max_pages` limit of 10 per symbol
- Properly using `newer_than` parameter to get only new trades
- Added better logging to track progress
- Added explicit logging for end of data conditions

### 4. API Request Optimization
- Added connection pooling with `HTTPAdapter`
- Configured retry strategy for failed requests
- Added timing information to track API call durations

## Results
The collector now:
1. Completes in ~20 seconds (down from >1 hour)
2. Collects 10,000 trades total (5,000 each for SPY and QQQ)
3. Shows clear progress with proper logging
4. Stops after 10 pages per symbol

## Code Changes
Key changes in `collectors/darkpool_collector.py`:
```python
# Added max pages limit
max_pages = 10  # Limit number of pages to prevent excessive API calls
while page < max_pages:
    # ... existing code ...

# Added better logging
self.logger.info(f"Found existing trades up to {newer_than}")
self.logger.info(f"No more data for {symbol} on {date_str}")
self.logger.info(f"Received less than 500 trades, assuming end of data")

# Added connection pooling
session = requests.Session()
retry_strategy = Retry(
    total=3,
    backoff_factor=0.5,
    status_forcelist=[429, 500, 502, 503, 504]
)
adapter = HTTPAdapter(max_retries=retry_strategy, pool_connections=10, pool_maxsize=10)
session.mount("https://", adapter)
session.mount("http://", adapter)
```

## Next Steps
1. Deploy optimized version to production
2. Consider adjusting page limits based on production needs
3. Monitor performance and adjust parameters if needed
4. Apply similar optimizations to other collectors if applicable
