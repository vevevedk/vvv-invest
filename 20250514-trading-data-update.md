# 2025-05-14 Trading Data Update: Aligning Local and Production Postgres Schemas

## Summary
This document summarizes the process of ensuring that the local development environment for the trading_data project matches the production Postgres schema. The goal was to guarantee that collectors (news and dark pool) can be tested locally with confidence that they will work identically in production.

## Key Steps and Troubleshooting

1. **Identified Schema Mismatch**
   - The local and production databases had different versions of the `trading.news_headlines` table, causing persistent errors (e.g., missing `content` column).
   - Discovered multiple schemas and tables with the same name in both `public` and `trading` schemas.

2. **Diagnosed Environment File Usage**
   - Ensured that the correct environment file (`.env` for local, `.env.prod` for production) was being loaded by all scripts and collectors.
   - Made the environment file configurable via the `ENV_FILE` environment variable for maximum flexibility.

3. **Schema Cleanup and Recreation**
   - Created and ran a script to list and drop all `news_headlines` tables in all schemas locally.
   - Recreated the `trading.news_headlines` table with the correct columns: `id`, `headline`, `content`, `url`, `published_at`, `source`, `symbols`, `sentiment`, `impact_score`, `collected_at`.
   - Verified the schema using a dedicated check script.

4. **Testing Collectors Locally**
   - Ran the collector test script with the correct environment, confirming that both the News Collector and Dark Pool Collector worked without schema errors.
   - Ensured the local environment is now fully in sync with production requirements.

## Outcome
- The local `trading_data` database now matches the production schema.
- All collectors can be tested locally with confidence that they will work in production.
- The process and scripts used are documented for future reference and troubleshooting.

## Next Steps
- Proceed to deploy the updated collectors and schema to production.
- Use the same scripts and environment management approach to keep local and production environments in sync.
