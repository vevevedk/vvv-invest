# Development Work Notes - May 25, 2025

## News Collector Review & Issues

### Current Status
- The news collector is configured to run every 5 minutes via Celery
- Last successful collection was at 06:45 CEST today
- Celery processes were restarted at 21:56 CEST today
- Found environment variable loading issues when trying to manually trigger the collector

### Issues Identified
1. Environment Variables:
   - Environment variables not being loaded properly in the virtual environment
   - `UW_API_TOKEN` not set when trying to run collector manually
   - Need to ensure `.env.prod` is properly loaded in the Celery environment

2. Data Collection:
   - All sentiment values from API are currently "neutral"
   - Impact scores are not being returned by the API
   - Need to contact Unusual Whales API support about these issues

### Next Steps
1. Fix Environment Variables:
   - Review how environment variables are loaded in Celery configuration
   - Ensure `.env.prod` is properly loaded in the Celery worker environment
   - Test manual task execution after fixing environment variables

2. API Issues:
   - Contact Unusual Whales API support about:
     - All sentiment values being "neutral"
     - Missing impact scores in API response
   - Document API limitations while waiting for response

3. Monitoring:
   - Set up monitoring for news collector task execution
   - Add logging for API response validation
   - Track sentiment and impact score distribution

## Questions to Address
1. Should we implement a fallback sentiment analysis if API continues to return only neutral values?
2. Do we need to adjust the collection schedule to better align with market hours?
3. Should we add automated alerts for when the collector hasn't run for an extended period?

## Summary
- News collector is running but needs environment variable fixes
- API is currently returning limited data (neutral sentiment only)
- Need to coordinate with API provider about data quality issues

## Prioritized Work List

### CRITICAL (Fix Immediately)
1. **Environment Variable Fix**
   - Current issue: Collector not running due to environment variable loading problems
   - Impact: No data collection
   - Action items:
     - Create centralized config module
     - Fix environment loading in Celery workers
     - Update service files to properly load `.env.prod`

2. **Service Reliability**
   - Current issue: Collector stopped running after 06:45 CEST
   - Impact: Missing data collection
   - Action items:
     - Add health checks to services
     - Implement automatic recovery
     - Set up monitoring for service status

### HIGH PRIORITY (Fix This Week)
3. **API Integration Issues**
   - Current issue: All sentiment values "neutral", missing impact scores
   - Impact: Reduced data quality
   - Action items:
     - Contact Unusual Whales API support
     - Document current API limitations
     - Plan fallback sentiment analysis if needed

4. **Monitoring Setup**
   - Current issue: No visibility into collector status
   - Impact: Delayed issue detection
   - Action items:
     - Implement basic monitoring
     - Set up alerts for service status
     - Add logging for API responses

### MEDIUM PRIORITY (Fix This Month)
5. **Code Organization**
   - Current issue: Duplicate implementations and configurations
   - Impact: Maintenance overhead
   - Action items:
     - Consolidate Celery configurations
     - Merge duplicate news collector implementations
     - Standardize logging

6. **Data Quality**
   - Current issue: Inconsistent data collection
   - Impact: Reduced data reliability
   - Action items:
     - Implement data validation
     - Add data quality checks
     - Set up data quality monitoring

### LOW PRIORITY (Fix When Possible)
7. **Documentation**
   - Current issue: Incomplete documentation
   - Impact: Knowledge gaps
   - Action items:
     - Update deployment documentation
     - Document environment setup
     - Create troubleshooting guide

8. **Performance Optimization**
   - Current issue: Potential inefficiencies
   - Impact: Resource usage
   - Action items:
     - Review database queries
     - Optimize API calls
     - Implement caching where appropriate
