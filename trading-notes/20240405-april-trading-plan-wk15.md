## PROFIT TARGET STRATEGY

To accelerate capital growth for Unit 1 acquisition (1.12M DKK goal):
- Revised weekly profit target: 18,000-20,000 DKK
- Required return: ~16.4-18.2% on utilized margin
- With 75-80% margin utilization (~95,000 DKK), required weekly return of ~19-21%

### Profit Distribution Expectation
- Bear Call Spreads: ~10,000-12,000 DKK profit (55-60% of target)
- Long Puts: ~6,000-7,000 DKK profit (30-35% of target)
- Calendar Spreads: ~2,000-3,000 DKK profit (10-15% of target)

### Capital Growth Projection
- Starting capital (Week 14): 122,000 DKK
- Week 18 target: ~200,000 DKK
- Week 22 target: ~390,000 DKK
- Week 26 target: ~650,000 DKK
- Week 30 target: ~980,000 DKK
- Week 33 target: >1,120,000 DKK (Unit 1 acquisition threshold)

## RISK MANAGEMENT

### Key Risks
1. **Recovery Rally**: Markets may stage a recovery if trade tensions ease or Fed signals support
2. **Data Surprise**: Weaker inflation data could trigger short-covering rally
3. **Technical Bounce**: Markets are oversold and could see a technical rebound
4. **Accelerated Capital Requirements**: Higher risk profile due to aggressive capital growth targets

### Enhanced Protection Measures
1. **Position Sizing**: Larger overall allocation but maintained diversification across strategies
2. **Stop Losses**: Strict adherence to predefined stop levels for all positions
3. **Time-Based Exits**: Predetermined exit points before key economic events
4. **Profit Taking**: More aggressive profit-taking on 1/3 of positions at 30% target
5. **Capital Preservation Rule**: If weekly drawdown exceeds 12%, immediately reduce position sizes by 40%
6. **Stress Testing**: Daily review of portfolio against 10% adverse move scenario
7. **Liquidity Planning**: Maintain 25-30K DKK in easily liquidated positions for end-of-month withdrawal

## ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS

### Bullish Reversal Scenario
If SPY bounces strongly above $515 on Monday with declining VIX:
- Pivot to bull put spreads on SPY (495/490) and QQQ (410/405)
- Implement iron condors with wider wings to capitalize on elevated volatility
- Reduce overall position sizing to 60% of maximum allocation
- Focus on capturing volatility premium through calendar spreads

### Sideways Consolidation Scenario
If SPY trades in a tight range between $500-$510:
- Maintain bear call spreads at planned size
- Reduce long put component by 50%
- Add iron condors or iron butterflies centered on the consolidation range
- Increase calendar spread allocation to 20%

### Extreme Bearish Acceleration
If SPY breaks below $495 with increasing volume and VIX above 75:
- Increase long put allocation to 40-45%
- Use bear call spreads with wider spreads but more contracts
- Consider adding small VIX put positions as hedge against volatility collapse
- Implement 30% profit-taking rule on all positions showing gains
