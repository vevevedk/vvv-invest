# SPY Trading Plan for April 2nd, 2025 (Liberation Day)

## Dark Pool Analysis

After analyzing the April 2nd expiration dark pool data, several key insights emerge for our bearish position that requires SPY below $555:

1. **Institutional Positioning**: The majority of large premium trades are bearish put purchases concentrated in the $551-556 strike range, supporting our thesis of downward movement.

2. **Premium Distribution**: Significant bearish premium ($645K and $320K put buys) outweighs bullish premium in the critical $551-560 range, suggesting institutions expect weakness.

3. **Strike Clustering**: The most active strike prices are $553 (bearish/bullish split) and $551 (predominantly bearish), indicating these are key technical levels.

## Market Context

- Current SPY price: $558, down 0.7% from yesterday's close of $562
- Trump's "Liberation Day" tariff announcement scheduled for 3 PM EDT today
- Expected to include 25% tariffs on Canadian/Mexican imports and potentially 20% on all US trading partners
- VIX has spiked to 22, up 10% from yesterday

## Trading Strategy

1. **Maintain Bearish Position**: The dark pool data supports our thesis that SPY will break below $555 today during the tariff announcement. Data shows institutions have positioned for this move.

2. **Entry/Exit Points**:
   - If SPY drops below $555 as expected, consider taking profits on bear calls
   - Key support levels to watch are $553 and $551 based on dark pool clustering
   - $559-$560 appears to be a resistance zone based on put selling activity

3. **Risk Management**:
   - With 44% margin utilization, we have capacity to add bull put spreads if market unexpectedly rallies
   - Consider bull put spreads with short leg at $545-550 as a counter-balance
   - The most significant risk is if the market interprets tariffs as bullish (e.g., if less severe than feared)

4. **Timing**:
   - Primary market reaction expected during/after Trump's 3 PM EDT announcement
   - Morning session may see positioning ahead of the announcement
   - Watch volume carefully for indications of institutional activity

## Key Levels

- **Primary Target**: $553-$555 (strong institutional interest at these strikes)
- **Secondary Target**: $550-$551 (further downside potential based on put buying)
- **Resistance**: $560 (multiple put sells at this strike suggest resistance)

## Conclusion

The dark pool data strongly supports our bearish thesis requiring SPY below $555. Institutions have positioned for a downward move following Trump's tariff announcement, with significant premium deployed to puts at and below our critical $555 level. Maintain our bearish position, with readiness to take profits if/when SPY breaks below $555 during the announcement.
