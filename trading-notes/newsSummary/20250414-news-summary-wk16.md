# Week 16 (April 14, 2025) Market News Summary

## Market Response to Tariff Exemptions

Markets are responding strongly positive to the weekend news that the Trump administration has exempted smartphones, computers, and other electronic products from the steep 145% reciprocal tariffs. Key developments:

- Asian markets led gains with Hong Kong's Hang Seng up 2.7%, with tech stocks like Lenovo Group surging 5.4%
- US futures indicated a strong open, with S&P 500 futures up approximately 1.5% and Nasdaq futures up 1.8%
- Despite the positive market response, President Trump clarified via social media that "NOBODY is getting off the hook" and that electronics would still be subject to the existing 20% fentanyl tariffs
- Trump announced a forthcoming "National Security Tariff Investigation" specifically targeting semiconductors and "the whole electronics supply chain"

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick reinforced this message, indicating the exemptions should be viewed as temporary, with these products likely to face "special-focus type of tariff" in the future as part of the effort to reshore semiconductor production.

## China Data and Response

China reported stronger-than-expected trade figures for March:
- Trade surplus jumped to $102.64 billion (vs. expectations of $74.30 billion)
- Exports surged 12.4% year-on-year, far exceeding the 4.4% forecast
- The surge likely reflects increased front-loading by Chinese exporters before the imposition of US tariffs
- Imports fell 4.3% year-on-year (vs. expectations for a 2% drop), reflecting sluggish domestic demand

China's commerce ministry called on the United States to "completely cancel" its reciprocal tariffs, characterizing the electronics exemptions as merely a "small step" in correcting what it views as a misguided policy.

## Gold and Safe Haven Assets

- Gold prices pulled back slightly from record highs, down about 0.3% to $3,225.79/oz after hitting a record $3,245.69/oz last week
- Goldman Sachs raised its end-2025 gold price forecast to $3,700/oz from $3,300/oz, its third such increase this year
- The bank cited stronger-than-expected demand from central banks and higher ETF inflows due to recession risks
- In a recession scenario, Goldman projects gold could reach $3,880/oz by year-end

## Stocks to Watch

Several stocks are holding near buy points despite the extreme market volatility:

1. **Spotify Technology (SPOT)** - Trading near a buy point of 621.20 from a double-bottom base, currently at 543.66
2. **TJX Companies (TJX)** - Just above a 127.58 buy point from a double-bottom base
3. **Howmet Aerospace (HWM)** - 9% below a 138.06 buy point from a double-bottom base

5. **Life Time Group (LTH)** - Approaching a 32.85 buy point from a double-bottom base with its relative strength line at all-time highs

Market technicians caution that investors should wait for a confirmed follow-through day before declaring a new uptrend, noting that historically, some of the strongest single-day gains occur during bear markets and are often followed by renewed selling.
