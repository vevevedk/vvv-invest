# April 16, 2025 News Summary & Strategy Update

## Key Insights from April 16 News

### Fed Policy Outlook
- Macquarie analysts suggest the Fed may need to see "private credit market instability" before adopting a more dovish stance
- They expect cracks to emerge first in highly-leveraged markets like the leveraged loan market
- Fed Chair Powell has indicated a "wait and see" approach amid tariff uncertainty
- Fed Governor Waller believes tariffs will have a "transitory" effect on inflation

### Trade War Developments
- Trump temporarily exempted electronics (smartphones, laptops, PCs) from tariffs
- Universal 10% tariffs on many countries remain in place along with specific tariffs on steel, aluminum, autos
- China faces 145% tariffs with 125% retaliatory levies
- Commerce Secretary Lutnick indicated potential new sector-specific duties on electronics, semiconductors, and pharmaceuticals in "the next month or two"

### Foreign Exposure to US Assets
- Deutsche Bank analysis shows foreigners hold $7 trillion in US fixed income and $18 trillion in equities
- 90% of the increase since 2010 is due to asset appreciation rather than new flows
- European exposure to US assets has quadrupled from 5% to 20% of portfolios
- Most foreign holdings of US equities are unhedged, creating significant currency risk

## Comparison with Previous Trading Strategies

### "Sell the Rip" Strategy Validation
Our April 15 analysis recommended a "sell the rip" strategy, which is reinforced by:
- Deutsche Bank's warning about overexposure to US assets
- Bank of America's previous warning about potential 35% S&P 500 decline (to 4,000 level)
- The April 16 news confirms institutional investors may be "shunning" US assets
- The unhedged currency exposure creates additional risk for foreign investors

### Gold & Safe Haven Positioning
Our previous safe haven strategy still appears sound:
- The trade war escalation continues with no clear resolution
- Fed's reluctance to quickly cut rates during tariff-induced economic stress increases market risk
- Previous analysis showed gold at record highs above $3,200/oz with Goldman Sachs target of $3,700
- Swiss Franc continues to strengthen as a safe haven, which aligns with our previous recommendations

### Sector & Risk Management Implications
- The April 16 news reinforces concerns about credit markets that weren't as prominent in previous analyses
- Macquarie's focus on leveraged loan markets suggests monitoring credit-sensitive sectors
- The news about potential semiconductor and pharmaceutical tariffs adds risk to sectors previously considered partially sheltered

## Strategic Updates Based on New Information

1. **Credit Market Focus**: Add monitoring of leveraged loan ETFs and high-yield credit spreads as potential early warning indicators of the instability Macquarie mentions

2. **Currency Hedge Consideration**: For any remaining US equity exposure, consider currency hedging given Deutsche Bank's warning about unhedged foreign positions

3. **Semiconductor/Pharma Risk**: Previous strategies may have underestimated tariff risk to these sectors; consider reducing exposure ahead of Commerce Department's investigation results

4. **Fed Put Recalibration**: Adjust expectations about how quickly the Fed might respond to market stress; Powell's comments suggest higher pain threshold before policy easing

The April 16 news generally reinforces our previous "sell the rip" and safe haven strategies while adding nuance about credit markets, the Fed's stance, and specific sector risks. The core themes of trade war escalation, gold/Swiss Franc positioning, and caution on US equities remain valid.
