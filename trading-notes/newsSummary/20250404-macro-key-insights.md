## Market Outlook
- **Short-term (1-3 days)**:

  - QQQ expected trading range: $445-$465

## Sector Impact Assessment
- **Most Vulnerable Sectors**:
  - Technology: Global supply chain disruption, EU retaliation targeting tech revenues
  - Consumer Discretionary: Higher import costs, reduced consumer spending
  - Industrials: Manufacturing slowdown, higher input costs

- **Potential Outperformers**:
  - Domestic-focused small caps (less trade exposure)
  - Healthcare (defensive positioning)
  - Utilities (safe haven during volatility)

## Trading Implications
- Heightened volatility creates both risk and opportunity
- Position sizing should be reduced by 30-40% during this volatile period
- Allow wider strike selection on option trades (minimum 2-3% buffer)
- Consider scaling into positions rather than full allocation at once
- Establish firm profit targets and stop-loss levels before entry
