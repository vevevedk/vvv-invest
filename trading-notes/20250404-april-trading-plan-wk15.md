### Position Management
- **Total Margin Utilization**: Target 60-70% of available 92K DKK margin (55-65K DKK)
- **Risk Distribution**: No single position should exceed 25% of total margin
- **Profit Taking**: Scale out of positions in thirds (1/3 at 30% profit, 1/3 at 50% profit, 1/3 at 75% profit or at pre-determined exit timeframe)
- **Pre-Event Exit**: Reduce positions by 50-75% before FOMC minutes on Wednesday

### Daily Schedule
**Monday, April 7:**
- Morning: Enter primary bear call spread positions on SPY and QQQ
- Afternoon: Evaluate market direction and add to positions if downtrend continues

- After FOMC: Reassess strategy based on market reaction

## PROFIT TARGET STRATEGY

To achieve 10,000 DKK profit target with 92,000 DKK margin:
- Required return: ~10.9% on utilized margin
- With 60% margin utilization (~55,000 DKK), required return increases to ~18.2%
- Strategy balances higher probability bear call spreads with higher potential long puts

### Profit Distribution Expectation
- Bear Call Spreads: ~6,000-7,000 DKK profit (60-70% of target)
- Long Puts: ~3,000-4,000 DKK profit (30-40% of target)

## RISK MANAGEMENT

### Key Risks
1. **Recovery Rally**: Markets may stage a recovery if trade tensions ease or Fed signals support
2. **Data Surprise**: Weaker inflation data could trigger short-covering rally
3. **Technical Bounce**: Markets are oversold and could see a technical rebound

### Protection Measures
1. **Position Sizing**: Smaller size on higher-risk positions (long puts)
2. **Stop Losses**: Clear price levels for exiting positions
3. **Time-Based Exits**: Predetermined exit points before key economic events
4. **Profit Taking**: Scale out approach to lock in gains as they develop

## ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS

### Bullish Reversal Scenario
If SPY bounces strongly above $515 on Monday with declining VIX:
- Cancel bearish positioning
- Consider bull put spreads on SPY (495/490) and QQQ (410/405)
- Reduce planned position sizes by 50%

### Sideways Consolidation Scenario
If SPY trades in a tight range between $500-$510:
- Maintain bear call spreads but at reduced size
- Skip long put component
- Focus on capturing theta decay in the range-bound environment
