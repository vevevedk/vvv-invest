## April 4, 2025

## INDEX ETF RECOMMENDATIONS

### SPY Bear Call Spreads
| Strategy | Sell Strike | Buy Strike | Expiration | Position Size | Max Profit | Max Risk | Break-Even |
|----------|------------|------------|------------|---------------|------------|----------|------------|
| Conservative | 545 | 550 | April 19, 2025 | 25% of max allocation | $0.85-1.00 credit | $4.00-4.15 per spread | ~546.00 |
| Moderate | 540 | 545 | April 12, 2025 | 15% of max allocation | $1.20-1.35 credit | $3.65-3.80 per spread | ~541.30 |
| Aggressive | 538 | 543 | April 12, 2025 | 10% of max allocation | $1.60-1.75 credit | $3.25-3.40 per spread | ~539.70 |

**Rationale:**
- The 545 level is approximately 1.5% above current price levels, providing reasonable buffer for intraday volatility
- Using multiple expirations provides staged risk exposure
- Short-dated options will decay more rapidly if the selling continues
- Position sizing is deliberately conservative due to extreme volatility

### QQQ Bear Call Spreads
| Strategy | Sell Strike | Buy Strike | Expiration | Position Size | Max Profit | Max Risk | Break-Even |
|----------|------------|------------|------------|---------------|------------|----------|------------|
| Conservative | 465 | 470 | April 19, 2025 | 20% of max allocation | $0.90-1.05 credit | $4.05-4.10 per spread | ~466.00 |
| Moderate | 460 | 465 | April 12, 2025 | 15% of max allocation | $1.30-1.45 credit | $3.55-3.70 per spread | ~461.40 |

**Rationale:**
- Tech sector leading the selloff, making QQQ an attractive target for bear call spreads
- Current price around $450, giving approximately 2-3% cushion
- Lower position size recommended for QQQ due to higher volatility

## IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

### Entry Timing
- Wait for any potential early morning bounce after NFP data
- Enter positions gradually throughout the day rather than all at once
- Best entry likely after first hour of trading when initial volatility settles

### Adjustment Triggers
- If market drops another 2% immediately after open, consider waiting or reducing size
- If market rallies 2%+ on NFP data, consider more aggressive entries
- Monitor VIX closely - if it spikes above 35, consider pausing new entries

### Exit Strategy
- Target 50% max profit for early profit-taking
- Consider closing positions before weekend if 30%+ profit achieved
- Set hard stop at 150% of max credit received
