- Resistance levels of concern: SPY 515, QQQ 445

### Risk Management
- Position sizing should be conservative given the strong bearish sentiment
- Implement stop losses especially for counter-trend bullish trades
- Consider hedging with VIX calls for broader market protection

## Key Observations from Dark Pool Data

1. The bearish sentiment actually *increased* after the tariff announcement (92.07% bearish for SPY post-announcement vs. 88.50% for tomorrow's expiries)
2. Institutions immediately began targeting higher strike puts after the announcement:
   * Average SPY put strike jumped from 502.83 pre-announcement to 515.49 post-announcement
   * Average QQQ put strike increased dramatically from 435.31 to 464.15
3. Next week's expiries (April 17) show even higher bearish sentiment (92.38% for SPY), suggesting institutions expect more downside beyond tomorrow's expiry.
4. The concentration of put activity at 490 for SPY suggests this is viewed as a key support level and potential target for institutional traders.

## Conclusion

The dark pool data from April 9, 2025 presents a compelling case for caution in the near term. The overwhelming bearish sentiment, particularly following the tariff delay announcement, suggests institutional investors are positioning for potential market weakness. The concentration of activity in specific strike prices provides valuable insight for both support/resistance levels and potential profit-taking targets.

As always, this dark pool analysis should be considered alongside other technical and fundamental factors, but the strong directional bias evident in the data warrants attention when planning trades for the coming sessions.
