## Analysis Summary

### Near-Term Market Expectations (April 16-17)
Dark pool traders are positioning with a bearish bias (66%) for very short-term market movements, though with significant support seen at the $538 level. The $539-$540 zone appears to be a key resistance area, with purely bearish positioning above these levels. The concentration of bearish activity at the $400 strike suggests some protection against a major market correction, but this remains a tail-risk hedge rather than the core positioning.

### Intermediate-Term Market Expectations (May 16)
For May expiration, sentiment is significantly more bearish (77%), with extensive put buying and call selling activity. The concentration of bearish trades in the $510-$520 range suggests traders are anticipating potential downside to this level within the next month. There is a notable absence of bullish positioning at strikes above the current market price, indicating limited expectation for upside beyond current levels.

### Overall Directional Bias
The data shows progressively more bearish sentiment as the time horizon extends from April to May, suggesting traders expect market conditions to deteriorate over time. The immediate support at the $538 level appears important for short-term market dynamics, while the $510-$520 zone may represent a target area that institutional traders are positioning for in the next 30 days.
