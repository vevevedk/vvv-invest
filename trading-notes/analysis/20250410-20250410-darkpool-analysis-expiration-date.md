## Conclusion

Despite the market rally following Trump's tariff pause announcement, dark pool activity indicates institutional traders remain overwhelmingly bearish on both SPY and QQQ for today's expiration. The concentrated put buying and call selling, particularly after the announcement and in late trading, suggests expectations of a potential reversal. Traders should monitor key support and resistance levels carefully, with particular attention to tech sector weakness as indicated by the more extreme bearish positioning in QQQ.
