## PROFIT TARGET STRATEGY

To accelerate capital growth for Unit 1 acquisition (1.12M DKK goal):
- Revised weekly profit target: 15,000-18,000 DKK (reduced from 18,000-20,000 DKK)
- Required return: ~13.6-16.4% on utilized margin (reduced from 16.4-18.2%)
- With 65-70% margin utilization (~80,000 DKK), required weekly return of ~18-22%

### Profit Distribution Expectation
- Bear Call Spreads: ~8,000-10,000 DKK profit (reduced from 10,000-12,000 DKK)
- Long Puts: ~5,000-6,000 DKK profit (reduced from 6,000-7,000 DKK)
- Calendar Spreads: ~2,000 DKK profit (reduced from 2,000-3,000 DKK)

### Capital Growth Projection
- Starting capital (Week 14): 122,000 DKK
- Week 18 target: ~190,000 DKK (reduced from 200,000 DKK)
- Week 22 target: ~370,000 DKK (reduced from 390,000 DKK)
- Week 26 target: ~620,000 DKK (reduced from 650,000 DKK)
- Week 30 target: ~930,000 DKK (reduced from 980,000 DKK)
- Week 34 target: >1,120,000 DKK (Unit 1 acquisition threshold, pushed back 1 week)

## RISK MANAGEMENT

### Key Risks
1. **Relief Bounce**: Markets are extremely oversold with potential for sharp short-covering rally
2. **International Developments**: Tariff negotiations or exemptions could cause sudden reversals
3. **Data Surprise**: Weaker inflation data could trigger significant short-covering
4. **Sector Rotation**: Taiwan's non-retaliatory stance may benefit semiconductor stocks

### Enhanced Protection Measures
1. **Position Sizing**: More conservative allocation with split entries to manage bounce risk
2. **Stop Levels**: Strict adherence to predefined stop levels, especially around key resistance
3. **VIX Monitoring**: Exit signals include VIX falling below 35 after being above 45
4. **Time-Based Exits**: Predetermined exit points before key economic events
5. **Profit Taking**: More aggressive profit-taking on 1/3 of positions at 30% target
6. **Capital Preservation Rule**: If weekly drawdown exceeds 10%, immediately reduce position sizes by 50%
7. **Taiwan/Semiconductor Monitoring**: Track semiconductor relative strength as a leading indicator
8. **Liquidity Planning**: Maintain 30-35K DKK in easily liquidated positions for end-of-month withdrawal

## ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS

### Relief Rally Scenario
If SPY bounces strongly above $515 on Monday with declining VIX:
- Exit most bear call spreads at predetermined stops
- Delay long put entries until clear resistance is established
- Consider short-term bull put spreads on SPY (495/490) and QQQ (410/405)
- Reduce overall position sizing to 50% of maximum allocation
- Focus on capturing volatility premium through calendar spreads

### Sideways Consolidation Scenario
If SPY trades in a tight range between $500-$510:
- Maintain bear call spreads at planned size
- Reduce long put component by 50-60%
- Add iron condors with wider wings to capitalize on elevated volatility
- Increase calendar spread allocation to 15-20%

### Extreme Bearish Acceleration
If SPY breaks below $495 with increasing volume and VIX above 50:
- Increase long put allocation to 40-45%
- Use bear call spreads with wider spreads but more contracts
- Consider adding small VIX put positions as hedge against volatility collapse
- Implement 30% profit-taking rule on all positions showing gains
