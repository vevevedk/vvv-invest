- Use time-based stops - consider cutting losses by today's close if market doesn't reverse
- Scale out partial positions at resistance tests rather than exiting all at once

### 2. New Bearish Position Setup

  - Sell 545 calls / Buy 550 calls (5-point spread at maximum resistance zone)
  - Entry timing: Wait for potential retest of yesterday's highs
  - Stop loss: Place at 552 (above the 550 strike with heavy interest)
  - Profit targets: First target 525, second target 515

- **QQQ Bear Call Spread**:
  - Sell 465 calls / Buy 470 calls (5-point spread at highest call activity)
  - Entry timing: On strength into resistance zone
  - Stop loss: Place at 472 (above the 470 resistance)
  - Profit targets: First target 450, second target 440

### 3. Position Sizing & Risk Management
- Keep position sizes modest (25-30% of normal size) given volatility
- Hard rule: No new trades without predefined stop losses
- Maximum loss per trade: 1.5% of account
- Implement time stops - close by Friday EOD if not profitable

## Key Observations from Dark Pool Data

1. The bearish sentiment actually *increased* after the tariff announcement (92.07% bearish for SPY post-announcement vs. 88.50% for tomorrow's expiries)

2. Institutions immediately began targeting higher strike puts after the announcement:
   - Average SPY put strike jumped from 502.83 pre-announcement to 515.49 post-announcement
   - Average QQQ put strike increased dramatically from 435.31 to 464.15

3. Next week's expiries (April 17) show even higher bearish sentiment (92.38% for SPY), suggesting institutions expect more downside beyond tomorrow's expiry.

4. The concentration of put activity at 490 for SPY suggests this is viewed as a key support level and potential target for institutional traders.

## Trade Execution Rules

1. No chasing entries - wait for price to come to predefined levels
2. Always place stops at the time of entry
3. Take partial profits at first target levels
4. No averaging down on losing positions
5. Reassess after CPI data release before executing new trades
6. Set price alerts at key levels: SPY 535, 525, 515, 490; QQQ 465, 455, 445, 435
