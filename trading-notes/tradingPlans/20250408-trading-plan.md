## Revised Trade Strategy

Given the accelerated downside, the recommended trades are:

### SPY Bear Call Spread
- Strikes: 495c/505c (reduced from 505c/515c)
- Expiration: April 17, 2025
- Contracts: 6 (increased from 4)
- Estimated premium: ~$2.20-2.40 per spread
- Max risk: ~$2,800-3,000

### QQQ Bear Call Spread
- Strikes: 415c/425c (reduced from 420c/430c)
- Expiration: April 17, 2025
- Contracts: 6 (increased from 4)
- Estimated premium: ~$2.00-2.20 per spread
- Max risk: ~$2,800-3,000

### Total Position
- Total margin utilization: ~42,000-45,000 DKK (~45-48% of available margin)
- Combined risk: ~5,600-6,000 USD (~38,000-41,000 DKK)
- This leaves room to scale in further if needed

## Entry Strategy

Given the rapidly moving market:

1. **Split Entry Approach**
   - First tranche: 4 contracts of each spread at open
   - Second tranche: 2 additional contracts if any bounce appears

2. **Price Monitoring**
   - Watch the 490 level on SPY (key psychological support)
   - Monitor 415 level on QQQ (critical technical level)

3. **FOMC Considerations**
   - Set 20% profit target to potentially close before FOMC minutes
   - Be prepared to take partial profits if 15% gain materializes pre-FOMC

## Risk Management

1. **Key Technical Levels**
   - Hard stop if SPY breaks above 495 with volume
   - Hard stop if QQQ breaks above 415 with volume

2. **Exit Timeline**
   - Primary target: Exit by end of day Thursday (before CPI data Friday)
   - Alternative: Take profits on any gap down tomorrow morning

3. **Profit Targets**
   - 20% of max potential profit for first partial exit
   - 30% target for full position

This strategy maintains the 10-point spread width for controlled risk while adjusting the strikes to account for the significant market movement. The increased contract size leverages the bearish momentum while staying within risk tolerance of 70-80% margin utilization if needed for scaling in.
