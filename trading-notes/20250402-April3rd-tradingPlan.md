# SPY Trading Plan for April 3rd, 2025 (Post-Liberation Day)

## Dark Pool Analysis

Analyzing the April 3rd expiration dark pool data reveals significant institutional positioning that can inform our strategy for tomorrow's trading session:

1. **Massive Bearish Put Wall at $577**: The two largest transactions are bearish put purchases at the $577 strike with combined premium of $2.5M. This indicates institutional players are expecting a sharp downside move beyond the current price levels.

2. **Bearish Call Selling**: Four of the top five largest trades by premium involve institutional players selling calls ($520, $500, $555, $556) with a combined premium of ~$1.9M. This signals expectations that SPY will stay below these levels through Thursday.

3. **Bullish/Bearish Split on $560 Level**: There is significant activity clustered around the $560 strike with both bullish and bearish positions, suggesting this is a key contested technical level for tomorrow's session.

4. **Put Buying vs Put Selling Balance**: There is approximately $5M in bearish put buying premium vs $1.5M in bullish put selling premium, creating a 3.3:1 ratio favoring downside moves.

## Context From April 2nd Plan

- Our existing bearish positions need SPY below $555 to exit profitably
- Current dark pool data for April 3rd suggests further downside potential
- Trump's tariff announcement today will provide the catalyst for tomorrow's market action

## Trading Strategy for April 3rd

1. **Managing Existing Position**:
   - If SPY remains above $555 after today's tariff announcement, consider holding through tomorrow given the significant bearish positioning for April 3rd
   - The $577 put wall suggests institutions are positioning for a potential 3-4% drop from current levels

2. **Key Levels to Watch**:
   - Primary Support: $555-$560 (heavy put buying and call selling activity)
   - Secondary Support: $550-$553 (logical target based on distribution of strike prices)
   - Upside Resistance: $565-$577 (based on put wall positioning)

3. **Risk Management**:
   - Consider partial profit-taking if SPY drops below $553 tomorrow
   - Maintain stop-loss discipline if SPY rises above $565
   - The options market is indicating higher volatility for tomorrow â€“ adjust position sizing accordingly

4. **Timing Considerations**:
   - Economic data tomorrow includes weekly jobless claims
   - Market reaction to today's tariff announcement will dictate the opening tone
   - Watch for consolidation patterns in the morning before potential directional moves in the afternoon

## Sentiment Analysis

The April 3rd dark pool data shows a significantly more bearish stance than the April 2nd data, suggesting:

1. Institutions are positioning for a multi-day bearish move following the tariff announcement
2. The size of the put positions ($577 strike) suggests preparation for a potentially severe market reaction
3. Call sellers are positioning aggressively to collect premium, betting against any immediate recovery

## Conclusion

The dark pool data for April 3rd strongly reinforces our bearish thesis. The massive $577 put wall ($2.5M premium) represents institutional conviction in a significant downside move beyond our current target of $555. The clustering of bearish activity suggests our thesis isn't just for today's session but extends into tomorrow as well. Therefore, if our positions aren't profitably exited today, there appears to be strong evidence supporting holding through at least part of tomorrow's session.
