# APRIL 2025 TRADING PLAN

## MARKET CONTEXT (Updated April 4, 2025)

### Current Market Environment
- Major market correction triggered by aggressive new tariffs (S&P down 3-4%, small caps down 5-5.5%)
- Heightened volatility expected through April
- Major support levels broken on key indices
- Significant pressure on MAG7 stocks (tech sector hardest hit)
- Increased recession probability (~40% per Head Coach Elliot's analysis)

### Key Economic Factors
- New tariff structure:
  - China: Additional 34% (total 54%)
  - European Union: 20% 
  - Vietnam: Sector-specific increases
- Potential supply chain disruptions and margin compression for companies with Chinese manufacturing
- Upcoming Fed meeting and employment data will be critical catalysts
- Administration appears comfortable with market decline ("MAG7 problem, not MAGA problem")

### Technical Analysis Snapshot
- S&P 500 below major support
- MAG7 stocks at critical technical levels (NVDA at $100 psychological support)
- Risk of cascading selling if recent lows are broken

## APRIL TRADING STRATEGY

### General Approach
- **Capital Preservation Focus**: Maintain higher cash position (minimum 30-40%)
- **Patience is Critical**: Avoid catching falling knives or buying early dips
- **Wait for Stabilization**: Look for positive divergences and bottoming signals
- **Best Opportunity**: Position for upside when market shows clear signs of reversal

### Entry Criteria
- **DO NOT** buy based solely on percentage drops
- Wait for:
  1. Market stabilization (2+ days of decreased volatility)
  2. Clear bottoming pattern or positive divergence
  3. Volume confirmation on up moves
  4. Headline catalysts indicating tariff compromise or de-escalation
  
### Position Sizing
- Start with smaller positions (25-30% of normal size)
- Scale in gradually as confirmation strengthens
- Maximum single position size: 5% of portfolio

### Sector Focus
- **Defensive Sectors**: Consider utilities, consumer staples, healthcare
- **Energy**: May be more insulated from tariff impacts
- **Domestic Manufacturing**: Watch for potential beneficiaries of reshoring
- **Tech**: Exercise extreme caution, wait for clear stabilization

### Exit Strategy
- Tight stops on any new positions (max 7-10% below entry)
- Take profits more aggressively (consider 15-20% gains as significant)
- Re-evaluate daily based on headline risks

## WATCH LIST

### Levels to Monitor
- S&P 500: Watch for test of recent lows, increased panic if breached
- VIX: Monitor for extreme readings (potential capitulation signal)
- NVDA: $100 level (psychological support)
- MSFT: 400 level and 200-day moving average
- META: 200-day moving average
- AAPL: Support levels around previous consolidation zones

### Headline Catalysts
- Watch for diplomatic responses from affected countries
- Monitor for any softening of tariff stance
- Fed commentary about economic impact
- Employment data implications

## MAY-JUNE OUTLOOK CONSIDERATIONS

### Potential Scenarios
1. **Quick Resolution** (20% probability): Diplomatic solutions emerge, markets recover quickly in May
2. **Extended Volatility** (50% probability): Trade tensions remain but don't escalate, choppy market through Q2
3. **Deepening Crisis** (30% probability): Retaliatory measures, higher volatility, increased recession risk

### Positioning Strategy for Q2
- Maintain higher cash levels through May unless scenario 1 emerges
- Watch for sector rotation opportunities as market digests impacts
- Consider defensive positioning until clear resolution path emerges
- Prepare for potential summer volatility (May-June historically challenging)

## RISK MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES

1. **Preserve Capital**: This environment rewards patience over aggression
2. **Smaller Position Sizes**: Scale in gradually rather than all at once
3. **Defined Exit Points**: Set stop losses before entering any position
4. **Diversification**: Don't concentrate in tech or China-exposed sectors
5. **Headline Risk**: Be prepared for rapid reversals on trade news
