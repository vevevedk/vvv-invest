   - Options Flow Collector (New)
     - Collects flow data per strike/expiry
     - Tracks institutional positioning
     - Monitors IV and volume patterns
     - Integrates with existing database

2. **Database** (PostgreSQL)
   - Stores collected dark pool trades (✓ Implemented)
   - New tables for options flow data
   - Cross-reference capabilities
   - Performance optimized queries

3. **Analysis Tools** (Python scripts)

   - Institutional flow tracking
   - Real-time alerts

4. **Local Analysis Environment**
   - Jupyter notebooks for analysis
   - Interactive visualizations
   - Backtesting capabilities
