# Development Work Notes - May 26, 2025

## Dashboard Implementation

### Current Status
- Created Flask dashboard for collector monitoring
- Implemented Slack notifications for collector status
- Set up basic authentication for dashboard access
- Created Nginx configuration for invest.veveve.dk

### Completed Tasks
1. Dashboard Development:
   - Created Flask application with secure session handling
   - Implemented real-time status updates
   - Added historical data visualization
   - Set up password protection

2. Infrastructure Setup:
   - Created Nginx configuration for reverse proxy
   - Set up systemd service for dashboard
   - Configured secure session handling
   - Implemented proper environment variable loading

### Pending Tasks
1. DNS Configuration:
   - [ ] Add A record for invest.veveve.dk
   - [ ] Verify DNS propagation

2. SSL Setup:
   - [ ] Install Certbot
   - [ ] Configure SSL certificate
   - [ ] Test HTTPS configuration

3. Security Hardening:
   - [ ] Generate and set secure dashboard password
   - [ ] Configure firewall rules
   - [ ] Set up rate limiting in Nginx
   - [ ] Implement IP whitelisting if needed

4. Monitoring Integration:
   - [ ] Connect dashboard to existing monitoring system
   - [ ] Set up alerts for dashboard availability
   - [ ] Implement logging for dashboard access

### Next Steps
1. DNS and SSL:
   - Configure DNS for invest.veveve.dk
   - Set up SSL certificate using Certbot
   - Test HTTPS configuration

2. Security:
   - Generate secure password
   - Configure firewall rules
   - Set up rate limiting

3. Monitoring:
   - Implement dashboard health checks
   - Set up alerts for dashboard status
   - Configure access logging

## Questions to Address
1. Should we implement IP whitelisting for the dashboard?
2. Do we need to set up backup monitoring in case the dashboard is unavailable?
3. Should we implement additional authentication methods (e.g., 2FA)?
