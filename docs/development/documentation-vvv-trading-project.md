# VVV Trading Project - Technical Overview

## Project Summary
VVV Trading is developing a sophisticated market analysis system that combines dark pool data with options flow to generate trading signals for SPY and QQQ. The project aims to identify significant institutional movements and market sentiment by correlating dark pool trades with options activity.

## System Architecture

### 1. Data Collection Components
- **Dark Pool Collector** (Implemented)
  - Collects dark pool trades every 5 minutes during market hours
  - Focuses on block trades and significant price levels
  - Uses UW API's darkpool endpoints with efficient rate limiting
  - Successfully operating within API limits

- **Options Flow Collector** (In Development)
  - Collects options flow data for market sentiment analysis
  - Focuses on both calls and puts for complete directional signals
  - Implements premium-based filtering to optimize API usage
  - Runs in sync with dark pool collection (5-minute intervals)

### 2. Data Storage
- **PostgreSQL Database**
  - Structured schema for both dark pool and options data
  - Optimized for time-series analysis and real-time queries
  - Efficient indexing for quick sentiment calculations
  - Data retention policies for storage optimization

### 3. Analysis Engine
- **Combined Signal Generation**
  - Correlates dark pool activity with options flow
  - Calculates market sentiment indicators
  - Tracks institutional positioning
  - Generates real-time trading signals

## API Integration

### Dark Pool API Usage
- Endpoint: `/darkpool/recent`
- Collection Frequency: Every 5 minutes
- Rate Limiting: Implemented with exponential backoff
- Error Handling: Robust retry mechanism

### Options Flow API Usage
- Primary Endpoints:
  - `/stock/{ticker}/option-contracts`
  - `/option-contract/{id}/flow`
- Collection Strategy:
  - Focus on SPY and QQQ only
  - Collect both calls and puts
  - Filter by premium size (â‰¥ $10k)
  - Track delta and IV for sentiment
- Rate Limiting:
  - Conservative request rates
  - Batch processing for efficiency
  - Caching of static data

## Data Processing Pipeline

1. **Collection Layer**
   - Real-time data collection during market hours
   - Efficient API request batching
   - Immediate validation and filtering
   - Error recovery and logging

2. **Processing Layer**
   - Real-time signal calculation
   - Sentiment analysis
   - Correlation detection
   - Alert generation

3. **Analysis Layer**
   - Market direction signals
   - Institutional flow tracking
   - Combined signal strength
   - Trading opportunity detection

## Technical Implementation

### API Usage Optimization
- Focused symbol list (SPY, QQQ)
- Premium-based filtering
- Efficient data structures
- Smart caching strategies
- Rate limit compliance

### System Reliability
- 99.9% uptime target
- < 1% data loss tolerance
- < 5 minutes maximum latency
- Comprehensive error handling
- Automated recovery procedures

### Performance Metrics
- Processing time: < 1 second
- Query response: < 1 minute
- API efficiency: Optimized request patterns
- Storage efficiency: Data retention policies

## Development Roadmap

### Current Phase
- Implementing options flow collector
- Integrating with existing dark pool analysis
- Setting up combined signal generation
- Developing correlation analytics

### Next Phase
- Enhanced signal generation
- Machine learning integration

- Performance optimization

## API Usage Projections

### Current Usage
- Dark Pool API: ~288 requests/day (5-minute intervals)
- Options Flow API: Projected ~288 requests/day
- Total: ~576 requests/day

### Future Scaling
- Maintain current request patterns
- Focus on data quality over quantity
- Optimize within free tier limits
- Plan for potential advanced features
