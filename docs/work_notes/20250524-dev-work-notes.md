## Schema Migration Work

### Darkpool Trades Schema Updates
1. Created and executed migration script `migrate_darkpool_schema.py` to align local schema with production:
   - Altered column types:
     - `tracking_id`: VARCHAR(50)
     - `symbol`: VARCHAR(32)
     - `volume`: INTEGER
     - `executed_at`: TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE
     - `sale_cond_codes`: VARCHAR(50)
     - `market_center`: VARCHAR(32)
   - Added missing columns:
     - `ext_hour_sold_codes`: VARCHAR(50)
     - `trade_code`: VARCHAR(50)
     - `trade_settlement`: VARCHAR(50)
     - `canceled`: BOOLEAN DEFAULT false
     - `id`: SERIAL UNIQUE
   - Set NOT NULL constraints on key columns:
     - tracking_id
     - symbol
     - size
     - price
     - volume
     - premium
     - executed_at
     - collection_time

### Data Management
1. Flushed local `darkpool_trades` table to ensure clean state with new schema
2. Attempted to run backfill for last 7 days (needs to be executed on production server)

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Run backfill on production server for last 7 days of darkpool data
   - Need correct production server address
   - Command to run: `celery -A celery_app call darkpool_collector.backfill --args='[7]' --loglevel=INFO`

### Validation Tasks
1. After backfill completes:
   - Validate data consistency between local and production
   - Check for any schema-related errors in collector logs
   - Verify all columns are being populated correctly
   - Compare data volumes between local and production

### Monitoring
1. Set up monitoring for:
   - Schema changes
   - Data collection volumes
   - Error rates
   - Backfill progress

## Notes
- Schema changes have been successfully applied locally
- Need to coordinate with production deployment team for backfill execution
- Consider creating automated schema validation tests to prevent future mismatches
- Document any differences found between local and production data after backfill

## Questions to Address
1. Are there any specific validation requirements for the backfilled data?
2. Should we implement additional logging for schema-related issues?
3. Do we need to update any collector code to handle the new schema requirements?
4. Should we create a rollback plan for the schema changes?

## Darkpool Collector Review & API Field Mapping

### Collector Status
- The dark pool collector fetches trades from the Unusual Whales API and inserts them into the `trading.darkpool_trades` table.
- All available API fields are mapped to database columns, including: `canceled`, `executed_at`, `ext_hour_sold_codes`, `market_center`, `nbbo_ask`, `nbbo_ask_quantity`, `nbbo_bid`, `nbbo_bid_quantity`, `premium`, `price`, `sale_cond_codes`, `size`, `ticker`, `tracking_id`, `trade_code`, `trade_settlement`, `volume`.
- Validation confirms that core fields are always populated, but some fields (`trade_settlement`, `trade_code`, `ext_hour_sold_codes`, `sale_cond_codes`) are frequently null in both the API response and the database.

### API Documentation
- The API documentation for `/api/darkpool/recent` and `/api/darkpool/{ticker}` has been updated to reflect all available fields and query parameters.
- The collector is using the correct endpoints and parameters for both incremental and backfill collection.

### Validation & Logging
- Validation scripts confirm that all mapped columns are being inserted when present in the API response.
- Plan to enhance logging in the collector to explicitly log when optional fields are missing from the API response, to distinguish between API limitations and collector issues.

## Next Steps
1. Enhance collector logging to record when optional fields are missing in the API response.
2. Continue monitoring for schema or data mismatches after backfill.
3. Document any persistent nulls as API limitations if confirmed by logging.
4. Review collector code for any further opportunities to improve error handling and data validation.

## Outstanding Questions
- Are there any additional fields in the API response that are not currently mapped?
- Should we add automated alerts for unexpected null rates in key fields?

## Summary
- The collector and schema are now aligned with the API.
- Most nulls in optional fields are due to missing data in the API response, not collector bugs.
- Logging improvements will help confirm this and provide a clear audit trail.
