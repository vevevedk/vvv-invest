# Development Work Notes - May 27, 2025

## Summary of Debugging and Deployment Session

### News Collector: Local and Production
- Refactored code to remove the unused `url` field from both the database schema and ingestion logic, based on Unusual Whales API documentation.
- Created and applied SQL migration to drop the `url` column from `trading.news_headlines` in both local and production environments.
- Updated all code to remove references to `url` and confirmed with verification scripts.
- Backfilled local database with realistic dummy headlines for the last 24 hours to test dashboard and ingestion logic.
- Verified that new records appeared in the database and that the dashboard reflected the latest data, though the status remained "stalled" due to dashboard logic.

### Production Deployment
- Committed and pushed all local changes to the remote repository.
- Pulled changes on the production server.
- Attempted to restart the news collector services (`news-collector-beat` and `news-collector-worker`).
- Both services failed to start due to an `ImportError`: `cannot import name 'DB_CONFIG' from 'flow_analysis.config.db_config'`.
- This is a result of the recent refactor to use `get_db_config()` instead of a static `DB_CONFIG` variable.
- Deployment halted to avoid issues during market hours; will reassess and fix import issues later.

### Outstanding Issues
- News collector dashboard status logic may need adjustment to reflect real-time health more accurately.
- Darkpool collector dashboard is in error due to missing `collected_at` column in the relevant table or query.
- Production Celery services for the news collector are currently down due to import errors.

### Next Steps (for after market hours)
- Update all code to use `get_db_config()` instead of `DB_CONFIG` and fix related imports.
- Re-deploy and restart services on production.
- Monitor logs and dashboard for successful ingestion and status updates.
- Review and fix dashboard logic for "stalled" and "error" states as needed.
