# Development Work Notes - May 26, 2025

## Dashboard Implementation

### Current Status
- Created Flask dashboard for collector monitoring
- Implemented Slack notifications for collector status
- Set up basic authentication for dashboard access
- Created Nginx configuration for invest.veveve.dk
- Successfully deployed dashboard with SSL
- Fixed Flask dependency issue

### Completed Tasks
1. Dashboard Development:
   - Created Flask application with secure session handling
   - Implemented real-time status updates
   - Added historical data visualization
   - Set up password protection

2. Infrastructure Setup:
   - Created Nginx configuration for reverse proxy
   - Set up systemd service for dashboard
   - Configured secure session handling
   - Implemented proper environment variable loading
   - Installed required dependencies (Flask)
   - Configured SSL with Certbot

3. Security:
   - Generated secure dashboard password
   - Set up HTTPS with Let's Encrypt
   - Configured secure session handling
   - Implemented rate limiting in Nginx

### Pending Tasks
1. Monitoring Integration:
   - [ ] Connect dashboard to existing monitoring system
   - [ ] Set up alerts for dashboard availability
   - [ ] Implement logging for dashboard access

2. Feature Enhancement:
   - [ ] Add data export features
   - [ ] Implement advanced filtering
   - [ ] Add user management

### Next Steps
1. Monitoring:
   - Implement dashboard health checks
   - Set up alerts for dashboard status
   - Configure access logging

2. Documentation:
   - Document dashboard setup
   - Create troubleshooting guide
   - Update deployment documentation

## Questions to Address
1. Should we implement IP whitelisting for the dashboard?
2. Do we need to set up backup monitoring in case the dashboard is unavailable?
3. Should we implement additional authentication methods (e.g., 2FA)?

# Debugging Session Summary - May 26, 2025

## Focus: News Collector, Database, and Environment Investigation

### Key Activities
- Investigated why the news collector was not inserting new records into the production database since May 25.
- Confirmed the collector process was running on production and logging successful inserts/commits.
- Validated that the dashboard and monitoring scripts were correctly reporting the last update as May 25.
- Ran local and production database queries/scripts to check for new recordsâ€”none found after May 25.
- Compared local and production database schemas; found them to be identical.
- Added debug logging to the collector to print DB connection parameters at runtime.
- Discovered that local runs of the collector were connecting to the local DB, not production, due to environment variable handling and `.env` precedence.
- Discussed best practices for environment variable management in Python projects (using a dynamic `get_db_config()` function).
- Outlined next steps for tomorrow: refactor DB config, ensure correct environment variable usage, and further investigate silent insert failures.

### Next Steps
- Refactor DB config to use a function that always reads current environment variables.
- Ensure collector and scripts use the same DB and schema.
- Investigate for silent transaction rollbacks, unique constraint violations, or triggers.
- Continue debugging with improved environment management.
