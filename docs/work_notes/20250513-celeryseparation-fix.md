# Celery Separation Fix - May 13, 2025

## Current Status
- The news collector is currently working in production using the old scraping implementation
- Recent database export shows active collection of news from multiple sources
- No immediate need to deploy the UW API changes

## Work Done
1. Identified and fixed import issues in `collectors/tasks.py`
2. Updated API configuration in `flow_analysis/config/api_config.py` to use correct UW API endpoint
3. Cleaned up `collectors/news_collector.py` to properly delegate to `UWNewsCollector`
4. Tested the changes locally with Celery worker

## Findings
1. Production news collector is functional:
   - Collecting from multiple sources (Tradex, PR NewsWire, Bloomberg, etc.)
   - Properly storing news in database with timestamps and metadata
   - Sentiment analysis and impact scoring working as expected

2. Database statistics (from export):
   - 306 news items collected
   - Date range: 2025-05-09 to 2025-05-10
   - 9 different news sources
   - Sentiment distribution: 8 negative, 237 neutral, 61 positive

## Next Steps
1. Hold off on deploying UW API changes since current implementation is working
2. Document the current working implementation for future reference
3. Consider UW API integration as a separate enhancement project
4. Focus on other priorities in the meantime

## Notes
- The current implementation uses direct scraping which is working reliably
- The UW API integration can be revisited when there's a clear need for change
- No immediate action required on the Celery separation fix
